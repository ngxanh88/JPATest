Step #1: Increase memory by configuring “domain.xml”

In linux, it is located under */glassfish3/glassfish/domains/domain1/config
(in windows C:\glassfish3\glassfish\domains\domain1\config)

There are two configs in domain.xml, server-config and default-config. Search for "-XX:MaxPermSize=" in server-config and set its value to 256m or higher.
(i.e. <jvm-options>-XX:MaxPermSize=256m</jvm-options>)

(Why server-config?
Because, from the Glassfish 3.1.1 doc:
The default-config configuration is a special configuration that acts as a template for creating named configurations. Clusters and instances cannot refer to the default-config configuration. The default-config configuration can only be copied to create configurations.)

 
Step #2: Restart server

Navigate to */glassfish3/bin
and run ” ./asadmin restart-domain domain1 “
or first ” ./asadmin stop-domain domain1 ” then “./asadmin start-domain“.

 
Note:

If the server not responding to these commands, first kill the glassfish process to free the port on which it was running (say 8080).
For linux based os:

- open terminal and type ” -sudo netstat -npl | grep 8080 “
- this will result in something like ” tcp6 0 0 :::8686 :::* LISTEN 10241/java “
- then use ” kill -9 10241 ” to kill that process (10241 in this case)
- Now try to start glassfish, it should start.
